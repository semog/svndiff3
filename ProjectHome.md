This small utility applet is written in C++ to keep the interface layering to a minimum when integrating your own diff3 program (such as Kdiff3) into Subversion or TortoiseSVN.  Subversion allows you to configure it to plug in a different diff3 program.  Most people will use a script file, but when running with TortoiseSVN, this can be very painful.  For every merge, a separate command console is launched and the interface script file is executed to launch kdiff3.  When merging hundreds or thousands of files, this quickly becomes unworkable.  In order to speed this up and to make it more seamless, a lower-level C++ shim is needed.  No interface console will be created. Instead, redirected console pipelines will be used, and any error return codes will be bubbled up to the user to display in a nice integrated error dialog box from TortoiseSVN.
